# P.R.A-comparison

This program runs a comparison check between two page replacement algorithms (P.R.A), the Least Recently Used replacement 
algorithm and the Optimal page replacement algoritm, to determine the better performer. It does this by generating 2 random 
reference strings and running them through both algoritms and comparing the the amount of page faults that each generates.
