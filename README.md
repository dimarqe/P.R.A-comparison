# P.R.A-comparison

This program is used to compare two page replacement algorithms (P.R.A), the Least Recently Used replacement algorithm
and the Optimal page replacement algoritm and determine the better performer based on the amount of page faults that occur.
It does this by generating 2 random reference strings and running them through both algoritms before comparing results
